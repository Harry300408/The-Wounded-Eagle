  ITA_V_Emmanuel_TWE_desc:0 "The so called 'Democratic King', Victor Emmanuel III created the 1st British-like constitution in mainland Europe where it was mostly either a 'pure' monarchy or a 'pure' republic with no inbetween (excluding the UK seen as they didn't want to get involved in European politics until very recently.) The constitution was created in 1905 after a widespread Liberal thought in Italy even Victor had Liberal ideas as a King. There was already an 'Italian' parliment however they were very restrained and was unnecessary for the time but once the constitution came into place the Government of Italy or the Governo italiano per il popolo (the Italian Government for The People) was given a large amount of power although laws could only be passed by the regent (the King/Queen)"

  ITA_a_mutilated_victory_desc:0 "After the Great War, the Italians were among the victorious nations beside France, Russia, and Austria. However, despite the acquisition of Tripoli, Eritrea, and Somalia, followed by the annexation of Dalmatia following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the people and the government of Italy felt like they weren't given enough territory, as it was small compared to the gains made by France and Russia. Parts of British West Africa were given to France while Austria seized control of Equatorial Africa and Namibia.\n\nRussia, despite losing much manpower in the war, was given control over Prussian Poland and northern China, along with almost complete authority and hegemony over the nation of China, giving them the power to dictate who among the Chinese warlord states would gain her favor. Because of what appeared to be a "stab in the back," extremist movements such as Mussolini's Partito Nazionale Fascista, Bianchi's Sorelian Party, and the Partito Socialista Italiano, founded by Filippo Turati and currently led by Pietro Nenni. Such extremist parties would not gain prominence and popularity until the London Stock Market Crash of 1929, which would ultimately bring the Italian nation to an economic depression.\n\nIt is only a matter of time before either one of these movements manages to seize the opportunity of seizing control of the government, along with the future of the Italian nation."

  ITA_political_divide:0 "Political Divide"
  ITA_political_divide_desc:0 "The political divide that has existed following the end of the Great War in 1919 has become difficult for the government to manage due to political infighting, the London Stock Market Crash of 1929, workers' riots, antisemitic conspiracy theories, rising crime, and nationalist fervor. This is especially true when concerning with far-left movements such as the Partito Comunista Italiano and Partito Soreliano Rivoluzionario Italiano on the one hand and far-right movement such as the Partito Nazionale Fascista and Ordine Legionario della Tradizione on the other, both of which have come to gain prominence within the political sphere whereas the comparatively moderate, mainstream parties continue to show signs of incompetence, hypocrisy, and corruption. There have also been a number of independence movements that see the concept of a unified Italy as a “failed project” that must be do away with, putting the nation's future into doubt. Given the public's growing dissatisfaction with the government's failure to find a unifying solution, it is no wonder that Italy is on the verge of a political upheaval. "

  ITA_economic_depression_desc:0 "Italy has been undergoing an economic depression since the London Stock Market Crash of 1929, resulting in crippling amounts of unemployment, crime, hyperinflation, and political instability.
