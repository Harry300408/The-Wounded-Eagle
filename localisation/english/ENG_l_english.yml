  ENGstart.6.d:0 "Today at 3:45, an organised strike quicky turned into a riot after a policeman attacked one of the protesters. This has caused thousands of pounds in damage and may even leave some shops bankrupt when trying to fund the repairs. People around the world have been awe-struck at these sights."

  ENGstart.6.a:0 "What's Going To Happen?"


  ## Starting Tree / Events ##
  ENGstart.1.t:0 "Welcome to The United Kingdom of Britain!"

  ENGstart.1.d:0 "Welcome to Britain! \nThere is a thing I need to say 1st, I believe in none of these ideologies, and they should not be practised in real-world situations! \nOn to some fewer cliché things. The United Kingdom of Britain (which will be shortened to KoGB aka Kingdom of Great Britain) obviously partook in WW1. However, this wasn't the normal Entente Vs Central Powers. The reason why well we (KoGB) won the war of 1812! This resulted in many ripples which will be explained by all other nations with content with more of the story revealing itself. \nThe side the KoGB joined was "The Liberation Front", Along with the Preußische Arbeiterrepublik, The Kingdom of Italy & Qing. Unfortunately, Italy & Qing peaced out due to humiliation in Italy and the Qing collapsed. But at this time the Ottomans wanted in. They had an excuse too, they claimed that Russia moved troops into Eastern Anatolia, which they had (into the Trebizond area). And thus joined the war. This however didn't affect anything, as "The Imperial Powers" were pushing on all fronts and very effectively! this resulted in The Liberation Front suing for peace and ending the war. \nObviously people were outraged and protests went up everywhere across the losing nations. However, this did not affect anything politically mostly they were put out by increasing the minimum wage, and it calmed down the people. But in Britain there was still bitterness. This led to an Irish revolt which ended in Ireland becoming a Dominion instead of being directly controlled."

  ENGstart.9.a:0 "What Do We Do?"


  ENGstart.10.t:0 "The Left"
  ENGstart.10.d:0 "Ever since the Industrial Revolution emerged in the 1830’s, followed by the rise and fall of the First Internationale between 1864 and 1876, the socialists of the far-left have been a thorn in the side of modern society, particularly that of the capitalists. In the course of nearly a century, movements have emerged under the red banner. As of now, some have grown into prominence following Britain’s defeat at the end of the Great War in 1919. It is these parties which now make up the radical far-left, including Oswald Moseley’s Maximal Unionist Party, George Orwell’s anarcho-communists, or Orwellites, Harry Pollitt’s Communist Party, and the International Workers of the World (IWW). The London Stock Market Crash of 1929 only escalated the growing number of leftists within the country, much to the dismay of the House of Windsor. Within Parliament itself, members of the Unionist and Communist party have grown into a sizable force in the form of a united coalition, rivaled only by the coalitions of the far-right and the moderates. However, infighting among the leftists remains a weakness that their enemies can exploit. Whereas the Communists preach the Marxist gospel of historical materialism, the Unionists, in turn, stress that the working class can only be able to rise up as a unified force against capitalism through the power of myth. The Orwellites, meanwhile, continue their anti-statist rebellion against Westminster and the royal family, deeply influenced by Orwell’s charisma as well as the works of Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin. As left-wing anarchists, they wish for a well-functioning, classless, stateless society and reject capitalism’s influence in their lives, claiming that both it and statism were parasites upon humanity that would ultimately fail them. Since 1919, reports of left-wing anarchist activity have been occurring across the British Isles, making life more difficult to the average Briton, both rich and poor alike. This comes despite the seemingly noble cause of freedom that the Orwellites often pride themselves with. Even the Communists themselves see the actions of the Orwellites as counterproductive, given that such attacks give the far-right an excuse to demonize the far-left while ignoring the fact that they are both just as extremely dangerous to society. So long as the callous, wealthy, privileged elites in Parliament continue to either ignore the crisis or fail miserably at fixing it, the far-left will continue to be a threat to the status quo."

  ENGstart.10.a:0 "Damm Those Commies!"


  ENGstart.11.t:0 "Radical Republicans"
  ENGstart.11.d:0 "The Republican movement in the UK has always been a problem, these "Republicans" want a more American style Government as the Constitution is "too opressive" and "goes against the right of the people". As republicans belive in rights for all. Even women and non-white (such as Asian & Black races) people."

  ENGstart.11.a:0 "Outragous!"


  ENGstart.12.t:0 "Anti-Semitism"
  ENGstart.12.d:0 "Ever since Britain’s defeat at the end of the Great War in 1919, the country has seen the rise of far-right groups that have long blamed the Jewish community for supposedly stabbing the fatherland in the back. Among the more prominent groups is the comparatively British Fascist Party led by Rotha Lintorn-Orman, the Free People of Britain led by Freda Du Faur, the fanatical Puritans led by Brother Edward Band, the National Vorticists led by Wyndham, the Anglo-Saxon Purity League by Sir Arthur Keith, and the National Syndicalist Workers’ Movement (NSWM) led by John Beckett, and, perhaps most infamous of them all, the British League of National Volkists (BLNV) under the command of the pro-German Archibald Maule Ramsay. The four most popular of these movements, the British Fascist Party, the NSWM, the BLNV, and the Anglo-Saxon Purity League, have gained about a fifth of the seats in Parliament in the form of a far-right coalition that is rivaled only by the slightly larger far-left coalition formed between the Communists, Moseleyites, and Democratic Syndicalists, as well as the more larger coalition formed between the Labour Party, the Conservatives, and the Liberals. However, as is the case with the other coalitions, the far-right suffers from political infighting due to differences in ideology and political strategy, which has only worsened when race and ethnicity. Being both an anthropologist , anatomist, and staunch promoter of “racial science,” Sir Arthur Keith argued that the English, Celts, Frisians, Scandinavians, and Dutch all make up what he considers to be the “true white race,” which he believes to be the pinnacle of human evolution and, therefore, superior to the likes of Semites, Germans, Mediterraneans, Finns, and non-whites. In contrast, both Archibald Maule Ramsay and Rotha Lintorn-Orman argued that the Germans, French, Balts, and Swiss are just as much a part of the Aryan “race” as the people that Sir Arthur Keith favors and that the Greeks and Italians are the descendants of the very ancient peoples that helped bring about civilization in Britain. In response, Keith argued that the Aryans, or Indo-Europeans, are nothing more than a “fairy tale,” stating that the only races that exist are the “true” whites and everyone else. John Beckett, on the other hand, views the very notion of “racial science” as a waste of time, claiming that anyone who isn’t a Jew, a capitalist, or a leftist is a comrade of the British worker, earning much hostility from the rest of the far-right. Meanwhile, outside the walls of Westminster, members of the Free People of Britain are rumored by superstitious locals and conspiracy theorists to be performing dark practices of the occult, some even claiming that they may be part of a Masonic plot for world domination, though there is hardly any actual evidence to suggest this. At the same time, gangs of antisemites and racists terrorize the Jewish, Roma, and black communities, often raiding whatever businesses they own. There were even some instances where the large, glassed windows of every store was vandalized with the Star of David next to the hateful slogan: “Don’t buy from Jews!” Already, the economic crisis has given way to a tidal wave of far-right terror upon defenseless minorities. All the more reason why Britain is on the brink of collapse."

  ENGstart.20.t:0 "Blood In London"
  ENGstart.20.d:0 "The streets in London have been running red with the blood of slain politicians and their supporters, brought about by a terrorist attack that saw the deaths of Philip Snowden, Clement Attlee, and a thousand other individuals. His royal majesty, King Edward VIII, was shot on his left leg, but has fortunately survived the attack. He personally informed reporters that the bullet was, in his own words, “little more than a scratch.” However, that is the least of our concerns, especially since political tensions have been on the rise since 1929, when the London Stock Market Crash gave way to a host of extremist movements with the intent of bringing our nation into the gates of hell.\n\n Leftists led by Oswald Moseley, George Orwell, and Harry Pollit have taken over Nottingham, forming a formidable coalition of Unionists, Anarchists, and Communists with the intent of overthrowing the Westminster government and the Royal Family. In Plymouth, Freda Du Flur and other reactionaries have begun their move by seizing control of southwest England with the aim of promoting what they refer to as the “traditionalist worldview” in defiance against what they see as “modernist degeneracy.” In Newcastle, reports of Catholic activity have led to the confirmation of a Neo-Jacobite League, seeking to install Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba as the “true king of Britain” under the christened name of James II, has taken over part of Northern England. However, there are also reports of a republican movement made up of English separatists on the one hand and Neo-Jacobites on the other, the latter taking inspiration from the French and American revolutions. Nationalist forces such as the Anglo-Saxon League, British Fascists, National Volkists, and National Syndicalists have seized control of Birmingham, declaring both the monarchy and Westminster as “too weak and unstable” to rule effectively while also attacking members of the Jewish community. \n\n No one knows who was responsible for the attack that has brought our already crippled nation into this point."

  ENGstart.21.t:0 "The Northen Occupation"
  ENGstart.21.d:0 "After the Scotish Nationalists took control of the Highlands the Scottish Government took this as a opportunity to suceed from the Union and usurp power from the British (now English) Governance who have been supressing the Scots for too long. Once their declaration of independece was announce/sent the Nationalist 'malitias' and Government troops occupied Glasgow & Edinburgh, the North of England went into turmoil with Jacobite sympathisers taking to the streets. Yet again the army was told to do nothing."

  ENGmon.1.t:0 "Drastic Measures"
  ENGmon.1.d:0 "Four days have passed since the King’s decision to arrest the demonstrators, and still the nation was yet to recover from the upheaval that was going on. Inside a dark, dull room stood a middle-aged man from Dublin who lost everything to the accursed British oppressors. His wife, his family, his house, all of that was gone. He worked hard at his job in the automobile industry only to be paid little by his boss. One day, when he got too tired and exhausted, he got fired. And because of that, he struggled and suffered as years went on. His troubles only got worse when the stock market crashed around 1929, driving him into poverty. He had nothing to lose now. He didn’t join the Orwellites just so he could just wallow in his sad, pathetic existence. No, he wanted to give all the rich snobs a lesson they would never forget.\n He counted the amount of bullets he had at his disposal before putting them inside his M1911. He put his hat on before leaving from the building at Oxford Street, hiding with a cheering crowd who were welcoming the man in the backseat of the car who dissolved Parliament. The same man who represented everything the poor fellow resented most: King Edward VIII. \n At last, he was present, all was going according to plan. The Orwellites have been planning for quite some time to give a message to the world that no one was ever truly untouchable, not even a king. George Orwell himself bever wanted the king dead, just deposed, but his most fanatical followers thought otherwise. The Irish man resented King Edward and his family, blaming the both for his suffering, the suffering of his fellow common folk, and the centuries of his ancestral homeland suffering from English rule. All his life, he was looked down upon by people outside of his blood, even by the Scottish. To them, he was just a “drunk paddie” fit only for servitude, a lower stage of human evolution, an inferior. He was fed up with all that cruel treatment. But he knew better than to put the blame entirely on people outside of his own. There some good souls among he encountered, most of them being fellow Orwellites. They too have suffered under the unbearable weight of statism and capitalism. \n The vehicle was coming closer to him now, his target along with it. His hand placed on the gun concealed in his coat, he walked towards the approaching automobile, seizing the moment. The shot was made."
