  ENGstart.1.t:0 "Welcome to The United Kingdom of Britain!"

  ENGstart.1.d:0 "Welcome to Britain! \nThere is a thing I need to say 1st, I believe in none of these ideologies, and they should not be practised in real-world situations! \nOn to some fewer cliché things. The United Kingdom of Britain (which will be shortened to KoGB aka Kingdom of Great Britain) obviously partook in WW1. However, this wasn't the normal Entente Vs Central Powers. The reason why well we (KoGB) won the war of 1812! This resulted in many ripples which will be explained by all other nations with content with more of the story revealing itself. \nThe side the KoGB joined was "The Liberation Front", Along with the Preußische Arbeiterrepublik, The Kingdom of Italy & Qing. Unfortunately, Italy & Qing peaced out due to humiliation in Italy and the Qing collapsed. But at this time the Ottomans wanted in. They had an excuse too, they claimed that Russia moved troops into Eastern Anatolia, which they had (into the Trebizond area). And thus joined the war. This however didn't affect anything, as "The Imperial Powers" were pushing on all fronts and very effectively! this resulted in The Liberation Front suing for peace and ending the war. \nObviously people were outraged and protests went up everywhere across the losing nations. However, this did not affect anything politically mostly they were put out by increasing the minimum wage, and it calmed down the people. But in Britain there was still bitterness. This led to an Irish revolt which ended in Ireland becoming a Dominion instead of being directly controlled."
