    social_liberalism_desc:0 "Social Liberalism is a variation of liberalism, with its most important characteristics being the inclusion of various civil liberties and human rights as being important, along with its view of the goverment as a positive force which ought to actively improve the life of its citizens by protecting their rights. Espousing progressive social and economic policies, Social Liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of status."
    market_liberalism:0 "Market Liberals"
    market_liberalism_desc:0 "Market Liberalism or Classical Liberalism is a economic and political ideology based on a powerful support and protection of a market economy, natural and private property rights as well as a political system that is democratic and/or plutocratic. In this sense, market liberalism depicts a political ideology, combining a market economy with personal liberty and human rights in contrast to social liberalism which combines personal liberty and human rights along with a mixed economy and welfare state."
    national_liberalism:0 "National Liberals"
    national_liberalism_desc:0 "National Liberalism is a variant of liberalism, combining liberal policies and issues with elements of nationalism. While progressive over some issues such as homosexuality and women's rights, National Liberalism can also sometimes be suspicious of foreigners and immigrants, though this does not prevent it from adopting civic nationalism as opposed to its more ethnocentric counterpart. Economically speaking, it also advocates for a free-market economy with very little to no government regulations."
    libertarianism:0 "Libertarianism"
    libertarianism_desc:0 "Libertarian Capitalism is a libertarian political ideology that advocates the promotion of maximizing the development of individuals by elimination of centralized state dictum in favor of self- ownership, private property and free markets. Those who adhere to it strongly emphasize the individual's right to liberty. They contend that the scope and powers of government should be constrained so as to allow each individual as much freedom of action as is consistent with a like freedom for everyone else. Thus, they believe that individuals should be free to behave and to dispose of their property as they see fit, provided that their actions do not infringe on the equal freedom of others."

Constitutional monarchies differ from absolute monarchies (in which a monarch is the only decision-maker) in that they are bound to exercise powers and authorities within limits prescribed by an established legal framework."

    semi_con_mon_desc:0 "The concept of semi-constitutional monarch identifies constitutional monarchies where the monarch retains substantial powers, on a par with a president in a presidential or semi-presidential system. As a result, constitutional monarchies where the monarch has a largely ceremonial role may also be referred to as 'parliamentary monarchies' to differentiate them from semi-constitutional monarchies."

  #National Corporatism
    nat_volkism:0 "National Volkism"
    nat_volkism_desc:0 "National Volkism refers to a variant of National Corporatism created by Adolf Hitler in the 1920's that holds disdain for liberal democracy, capitalism, and the parliamentary system, but also incorporates fervent antisemitism, anti-communism, scientific racism, Social Darwinism, and eugenics into its creed, along with technocratic elements.  It aims to overcome social divisions and create a homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people's community (Volksgemeinschaft). A key aspect of this ideology is the Führerprinzip, which states that the Führer's word is above all written law and that governmental policies, decisions, and offices ought to work toward the realization of this end.It is considered by most National Corporatist movements as being very extreme, mainly due to its adherence to antisemitism."
    classical_nat:0 "Classical Fascism"
    classical_nat_desc:0 "Classical Fascism, or simply Fascism, Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement, characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation and race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy. Borne out of the beliefs of disillusioned communists and authoritarian nationalists, fascism is often characterized as being "third positionist" due to its ideological inspiration from both the radical left and right. Although traces of Marxist doctrine can still be found buried in its worldview - it embraces a producer-parasite dialectic, but between nations instead of economic classes - its virulent nationalism puts it at odds with the internationalist mindset of most left-wing socialist movements. Classical Fascism's most defining qualities come from its slavish devotion to the state. The government, often under the control of a single strongman, serves as the final arbitrator and authority in the land. Religious institutions, trade unions, private businesses, and the like are permitted to exist in some limited form, though their subservience to the state's authority is made clear. The government also upholds a national mythos, spinning tales of a noble people with past glories that were unfairly stripped from them, and demands that the populace find strength in unity and reclaim what was lost."

Adherents of this ideology are notorious for their mad obsessions with tales of Atlantis, Hyperborea, and Thule, driven by the belief that the Aryan 'master race' is of divine ancestry. Materialism, Christianity, liberalism, Marxism, and egalitarianism are frowned upon and are often linked with the so-called 'Jewish conspiracy' that they thought was the source of their problems."
